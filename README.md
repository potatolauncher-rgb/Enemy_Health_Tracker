Enemy Health Tracker

I wanted to make a basic enemy health tracker for tabletop games. This project helped me acquire a better grasp of simple Javascript functions.
There are some functions that I would like to implement later down the line, once I have a better grasp of Javascript, specifically the implementation of JS frameworks.
